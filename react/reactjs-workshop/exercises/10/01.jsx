// Exercise 10/01
// ===========
//
// ::NOTE::
// --------
//
//  You will need to have completed the following Exercises successfully before being able to complete this one:
//    * Exercise 09/01
//    * Exercise 04/01
//    * Exercise 03/02
//
// Tasks
// --------
// ‚úÖ    Complete the `AppWrapper` component below.
// ‚úÖ    The `AppWrapper` component should only setup Redux for use with your `App` component (imported above).
// ‚úÖ    You should use the Redux store that we built in Exercise 09/01 -- already imported above.
//
// ‚úÖ    You Should complete the `App` component (see separate file in this dir).
// ‚úÖ    Your `App` component can include whatever you like, but must at least include the `DataTable` component we built during Exercise 03/02 and Exercise 04/01.
//        This has already been imported into the module scope for you (see the `./components/01-App.jsx` file).
// ‚úÖ    Your `App` component should accept 1 prop, called `consultantData`. The shape of this data can be seen in the `PropTypes` defintion at the bottom of the file.
//        The shape is the same as used in Exercise 03/02 and Exercise 04/01.
// ‚úÖ    Your `App` component should pass this data into our `DataTable` component.
// ‚úÖ    You should "connect" your `App` component to the Redux store. The required redux API has already been imported for you; you just need to use it.
// ‚úÖ    You will need to tell Redux how to transform the data in the store into the prop required by your `App` component
//
//
// ‚≠êÔ∏è    TODO
//
// Tips
// --------
// üê®     This exercise is split across more than 1 file
// üê®     From Exercise 03/02, our `DataTable` component requires input data from a prop named `data`.
// üê®     You don't have to worry about where the data is coming from; this will be handled for you behind the scenes.
//          The focus here is on wiring up our `App` component to our Redux store.
// üê®     Remember, we can instruct Redux how to convert data in our store to component props using a `mapStateToProps` selector.
