// Exercise 09/01
// ===========
//
// Tasks
// --------
// ‚úÖ    Create an Action creator for indicating that we would like to make a request for data.
//        This should be assigned to the `fetchConsultantData` stub below.
//        This should have the type: CONSULTANTS_FETCH_REQUEST (already defined below).
//        This action creator will not accept any input args; the `payload` key should be null.
// ‚úÖ    Create an Action creator for indicating that we would like to provide data received from a network request.
//        This should be assigned to the `fetchConsultantComplete` stub below.
//        This should have the type: CONSULTANTS_FETCH_COMPLETE (already defined below).
//        This action creator should accept a single input arg, which will be an array of consultant data.
//        This input arg should be stored within the action at `payload.data`.
//        The action should indicate if an error occurred using the appropriate FSA key
//        The action should include the error within the payload object on `data` when one is passed.
//
// ‚úÖ    Unless instructed otherwise, All actions should default their unused object keys to null when they don't have any data.
// ‚úÖ    All actions should adhere to the FSA [1] object structure.
//
// ‚úÖ    Complete the `reducer` using the stub below.
// ‚úÖ    Your reducer should return the default store state when `prevState` is undefined.
// ‚úÖ    Your default store state should be an empty array.
// ‚úÖ    The reducer should return the payload data to the store when the `fetchConsultantComplete` action is dispatched
// ‚úÖ    The reducer should return the previous state if any other action is dispatched
//
// ‚úÖ    Create a single store for our 'app' using the `createStore` method (already imported above)
// ‚úÖ    The store should be created without a `preloaded state`, preloadedState (only call with 1 arg) [2]
// ‚úÖ    The store should be configured to use our reducer we created in the above tasks.
//
// Tips
// --------
// üê®    Remember, FSA stands for "Flux Standard Action"
// üê®   [1] https://github.com/redux-utilities/flux-standard-action#actions
// üê®   [2] https://redux.js.org/api/createstore#createstorereducer-preloadedstate-enhancer

// Define our Action type constants
export const CONSULTANTS_FETCH_REQUEST = 'CONSULTANTS.FETCH.REQEST';
export const CONSULTANTS_FETCH_COMPLETE = 'CONSULTANTS.FETCH.COMPLETE';

// Define our Action Creators. These are used
// to signal that we want an update made to our store.
export const fetchConsultantData = null;

export const fetchConsultantComplete = null;

// Setup our reducer
export function reducer(prevState, action) {
  // to be completed
}

// Create our store
const store = null;

// Export the store to our test suite
export default store;
