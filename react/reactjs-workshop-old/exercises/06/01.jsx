// Exercise 06/01
// ===========
//
// We will take a short diversion here and explore "HOCs", or Higher-Order-Components.
// While the demo app doesn't define any HOCs directly, HOCs are one of the foundational advanced
// concepts in ReactJS, and can help abstract cross-cutting concerns across several components.
// They are also one of ReactJS powerhouse features: Composability.
//
// Although, while we won't define any inside the demo app, we will be using -- arguably the most
// popular -- one heavily when we explore Redux.
//
// Tasks
// --------
// ✅    You should define a `withMouse` HOC that injects the current mouse X and Y coordinates
// ✅    Your `withMouse` HOC should update the current coordinates in real time, as the user moves their mouse
// ✅    Your component should accept a `mouse` prop, which is an object containing the `x` and `y` nodes and correspond to
//        the current mouse (x,y) positions, respectively.
// ✅    Your component should render the current X, Y position by pulling the information from the `mouse` prop
//        The format should be: (x,y) including the parentheses.
//
// 🚫   Styling is out of scope
// 🚫   You are free to add additional text, markup, but we will only be looking for the current X, Y position of the mouse
//
// Tips
// ------
// 🐨  Use the `onMouseMove` Synthetic DOM event to capture the current X and Y coords of the mouse
// 🐨  Remember, you HOC `props` are READ-ONLY, so you'll have to store the updates somewhere else to trigger a re-render
//

export class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const { x, y } = this.props.mouse;

    return (
      <div className="">
        Mouse coordinates: ({`${x},${y}`})
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// Add runtime prop validation
App.propTypes = {
  mouse: PropTypes.shape({
    x: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
    y: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
  }),
};

// Define our HOC
function withMouse(WrappedComponent) {
  return class extends React.Component {
    state = { x: 0, y: 0 }

    handleMouse = (event) => {
      this.setState({
        x: event.clientX,
        y: event.clientY,
      })
    }

    render() {
      return (
        <div onMouseMove={this.handleMouse}>
          <WrappedComponent mouse={this.state} />
        </div>
      );
    }
  }
}

export default withMouse(App);
